This is a application that I wrote in attempt to learn more about file handling and modification. The general idea is to modify an existing video game. I've also included features such as a grid system, level swapping, statistics and tile data.</p>

We are looking at one of the levels, in this case. Instead of making modifications to this level through hex, I decided to write an application that would visualize the data instead.</p>

Like level data, I had to find the address for the palette within the file itself, so that I could manipulate the values through my windows form application and save it back into the file. This part of the project aids in making modification to the colors within the game.</p>
